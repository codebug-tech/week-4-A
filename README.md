# FACE IT! POSITIONING WITH CSS

##### Setup
- Copy the exercise from GitHub
- `cd` into the correct directory
- Checkout a branch under your name
- Open the `week-4-A` folder in sublime
- Use the command line to an `index.html` file and a `style.css` file

## Inside of `index.html`
- Use a `<link>` tag to link the style in your `style.css` to your html
- Add the three images from the images folder to your html using 3 separate `<img>` tags


## Inside `style.css` 
- Use the `position` property along with `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom` to move the images on the page. Here's a good resource: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp
- Make the face look somewhat like this:
